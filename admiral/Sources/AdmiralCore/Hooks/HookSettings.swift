/// Builds the per-session `settings.json` Admiral injects via `--settings`, exactly as it
/// injects `--mcp-config` for the bridge relay. It contains ONLY a top-level `hooks` block, so
/// it merges non-destructively: `--settings` overrides only the keys it names, and hooks union
/// across settings sources — the user's `permissions` and their own hooks are untouched.
///
/// **This is no longer a governance mechanism.** Governance lives in `hookd`, registered
/// globally. Admiral injects these events because each of its own features below is
/// delivered by a hook and by nothing else:
///
/// | event | why |
/// |---|---|
/// | `PostToolUse` | records touched repos into `sessions/<token>/touched.jsonl` |
/// | `Stop` | consults the structured-output tripwire (`set_structured_output`) |
/// | `UserPromptSubmit` | records the prompt the session watchdog reads for triggers, and the chat ledger's prompts |
/// | `Notification` | chat ledger: claude is blocked on a permission prompt |
/// | `PreToolUse` | denies the built-in `AskUserQuestion` while the tab shows Chat |
/// | `SessionStart` | after `/clear` or compaction, the goals reminder is sent in full again |
///
/// `PreToolUse` is matched to `AskUserQuestion`, so no other tool call pays for a hook process,
/// and `SessionStart` to `clear|compact`, the two sources that drop context; `PostToolUse`
/// filters by tool internally, and the rest take none.
