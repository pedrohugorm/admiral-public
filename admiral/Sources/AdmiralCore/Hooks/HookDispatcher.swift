/// Routes a hook invocation (`<cli-type> <event>`) to its handler. This switch is the single
/// dispatch site. Returns optional stdout the helper should emit (nil = nothing). An unknown
/// pair is a safe no-op so a misconfigured hook never errors.
///
/// The returned string is written verbatim to stdout, and the helper always exits 0: for
/// Claude Code, blocking *is* that JSON. So "no stdout" means "allow".
///
/// **Admiral does not govern.** Governance lives in `hookd` (a separate repo), registered
/// globally in `~/.claude/settings.json`, so it covers every session rather than only the
/// ones Admiral launched. What remains here are the Admiral features that a hook is the only
/// way to deliver:
///
/// - `PostToolUse` → the touched-repos log (`sessions/<token>/touched.jsonl`)
/// - `Stop` → the structured-output tripwire, which drives the `set_structured_output`
///   bridge MCP tool
/// - `UserPromptSubmit` → the prompt log the session watchdog reads for trigger detection,
///   the open-goals reminder returned as this turn's added context (in full only when it
///   changed), and the re-arm of the tab's `output` slot when it has an output schema
/// - `SessionStart` (clear / compact only) → forgets which goals reminder was sent, since
///   context no longer holds it
///
/// - `UserPromptSubmit` / `Stop` / `Notification` → also the chat ledger the Chat view renders
/// - `PreToolUse` (AskUserQuestion only) → denies the built-in while the tab shows Chat, so the
///   model uses the bridge mirror the chat can answer; otherwise it posts a native notification
/// - `Notification` (permission / elicitation / idle / agent input) → also a native notification.
///   Claude never emits OSC 9/777 under `TERM_PROGRAM=Admiral`, so the hook is what reaches
///   Notification Center. Delivery is `notifier` (`HookNotifier.send` in the helper, nil = off
///   in tests): bounded, best effort, never changes what claude does.
///
/// Every arm is an Admiral feature, so each needs `ADMIRAL_SESSION`; without it the arm is a
/// no-op. `HookSettings` registers exactly these events. Another one means a new Admiral
/// feature that needs a hook — never a rule.
